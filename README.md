### next steps

### to implement

- EDIT button for projects:
  - delete projects
  - rename projects
  - reorder projects
- deleting a todo or projects needs a confirmation popup
- if you open the edit window of a todo that has NO PROJECT, the project selector will still select one though. it would be better if there would also be a "blank" option in the selector
- update todo list header according to selected project/ time filter

### bugs

- deleting a project will cause an empty todo list, because beforehand it will select it as a filter when clicking the delete button
- if a project is highlighted and switching to eidt mode, highlight should be removed
- when adding a project like "Test Project" or "Test-Project" the second word wont be capitalized anymore
