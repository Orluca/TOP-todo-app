### next steps

### to implement

- EDIT button for projects:
  - delete projects
  - rename projects
  - reorder projects
- deleting a todo or projects needs a confirmation popup
- if you open the edit window of a todo that has NO PROJECT, the project selector will still select one though. it would be better if there would also be a "blank" option in the selector
- update todo list header according to selected project/ time filter
- bold text for selected filter
- edit project mode: vl den reorder handle ganze nach links, andere buttons weiter rechts und hintergrund color f√ºr jedes item

### bugs

- if a project is highlighted and switching to eidt mode, highlight should be removed
- when adding a project like "Test Project" or "Test-Project" the second word wont be capitalized anymore
- adding a new todo not yet updating the project counts
