### next steps

### to implement

- EDIT button for projects:
  - delete projects
  - rename projects
  - reorder projects
- deleting a todo or projects needs a confirmation popup
- if you open the edit window of a todo that has NO PROJECT, the project selector will still select one though. it would be better if there would also be a "blank" option in the selector
