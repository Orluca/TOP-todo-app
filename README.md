### next steps

### to implement

- EDIT button for projects:
  - delete projects
  - rename projects
  - reorder projects
- Todo-item: don't show fields that don't have any value (e.g. no date is given)
- deleting a todo or projects needs a confirmation popup

### issues

- if you open the edit window of a todo that has NO PROJECT, the project selector will still select one though. it would be better if there would also be a "blank" option in the selector
